___
By applying a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 5.49621582 MHz and amplitude of 1 V, the quantization wave doubt in the time domain, the quantization noise power spectrum and the output power spectrum of the A / D converter are plotted, and finally the parameters SFDR, SNDR, SNR, SNR. ENOB is calculated:) This process is done in MATLAB software.
